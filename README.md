# SOLID principle example

## Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only a single responsibility and only one reason to change.

## Open Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

## Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
One should depend upon abstractions, not depend on concrete implementations.
